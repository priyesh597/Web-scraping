It's down a backstreet so quite hard to find but worth doing so. It's free to get in, avoid Drakes Bar which is not and is dreadfully quiet.Date of visit: September 2015Ask Sevencakes about Q CafeThank Sevencakes This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\n\\n\\n\\nmika_koshonsonPisek, Czech Republic7423Reviewed August 12, 2015 Quite pleasant gay bar.This gay bar is agreeable place to visit, especially for their good coffee, but it is also possible to drink a beer there. For straight people who are not in search for meeting somebody, good time is in the afternoon, because the evenings and nights are quite alive there. Paintings or photos are exhibited on the walls and varies often. The toilets are most equipped of all the toilets I've seen so far (creams, cotton wool pads and other stuff). Despite that, during the nights, they are sometimes quite dirty.Date of visit: November 2014Ask mika_koshonson about Q CafeThank mika_koshonson This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\\n\\nPreviousNext1…678…Updating list...  \\n\\n\\n\\nTravelers who viewed Q Cafe also viewed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJericho\\n\\n\\n\\n21 Reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nPrague, Bohemia \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSad Man's Tongue Bar & Bistro\\n\\n\\n\\n5,051 Reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nPrague, Bohemia \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVaclavka Pizza Restaurant\\n\\n\\n\\n204 Reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nPrague, Bohemia \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiberica Cafe Valentinska\\n\\n\\n\\n93 Reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nPrague, Bohemia \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\n\\n\\nAll restaurants in Prague (6393)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeen to Q Cafe?

      "SevencakesGrimsby, United Kingdom8138Reviewed September 20, 2015 A very nice gay cafe bar.Small gay cafe bar, very good value food and drinks, table service and a fairly hip crowd, they even allow dogs in with their owners. 92k £3 for a decent cocktail was a highlight and it was a nice place to spend an evening in good company. It's down a backstreet so quite hard to find but worth doing so. It's free to get in, avoid Drakes Bar which is not and is dreadfully quiet.Date of visit: September 2015Ask Sevencakes about Q CafeThank Sevencakes This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n",

      "mika_koshonsonPisek, Czech Republic7423Reviewed August 12, 2015 Quite pleasant gay bar.This gay bar is agreeable place to visit, especially for their good coffee, but it is also possible to drink a beer there. For straight people who are not in search for meeting somebody, good time is in the afternoon, because the evenings and nights are quite alive there. Paintings or photos are exhibited on the walls and varies often. The toilets are most equipped of all the toilets I've seen so far (creams, cotton wool pads and other stuff). Despite that, during the nights, they are sometimes quite dirty.Date of visit: November 2014Ask mika_koshonson about Q CafeThank mika_koshonson This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.\n",
